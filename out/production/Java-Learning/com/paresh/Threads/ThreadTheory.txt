# THREAD
                        
--> A thread in Java is a lightweight process that allows concurrent 
    execution of code. 

--> It is a separate path of execution within a program, enabling 
    multitasking and efficient use of CPU resources.

--> com.paresh.Interface.Threads can be created by extending the Thread class or
    implementing the Runnable interface.


# THREAD LIFE CYCLE

**NEW** --> The thread is created but not yet started.

**RUNNABLE** --> The thread is ready to run and waiting for CPU time.

**BLOCKED** --> The thread is blocked and waiting for a monitor lock.

**WAITING** --> The thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action.

**TIMED WAITING** --> The thread is waiting for another thread to perform an action for up to a specified waiting time.

**TERMINATED** --> The thread has completed its execution.


# THREAD VS RUNNABLE

--> Thread
    - Extending the Thread class means that your class cannot extend any other class.
    - Each thread creates a unique object and associates with it.
    - More overhead as it involves creating a new thread instance.

--> Runnable
    - Implementing the Runnable interface allows your class to extend another class.
    - Multiple threads can share the same object.
    - Less overhead as it does not create a new thread instance.


# COMMON THREAD METHODS

1 : start() --> Starts the execution of the thread.
2 : run() --> Contains the code to be executed by the thread.
3 : getId() --> Returns the thread's unique ID.
4 : getName() --> Returns the name of the thread.
5 : setName(String name) --> Sets the name of the thread.
6 : getPriority() --> Returns the priority of the thread.
7 : setPriority(int priority) --> Sets the priority of the thread.
8 : getState() --> Returns the state of the thread.
9 : isAlive() --> Tests if the thread is alive.
10: join() --> Waits for the thread to die.
11: sleep(long millis) --> Causes the thread to sleep for the specified number of milliseconds.
12: interrupt() --> Interrupts the thread.
13: isInterrupted() --> Tests if the thread has been interrupted.
14: yield() --> Causes the currently executing thread object to temporarily pause and allow other threads to execute.
